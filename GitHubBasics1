1. Explain 3 of the following terms as they relate to GitHub: repository, commit, push, pull, clone, fork, merge conflict
  1) repository is the main storage space and all the things contained within a github
  2) push is the process of putting something onto the repository and pull is when you use the github to update a local set of files to match the         repository updates 
  3) clone is copying a github repository to your own computer/not online version and forking is when you make a copy of someone else's repo into         your own github repo

2. What is one concept/topic from Monday's class, if any, about which you would like further clarification?
I was not able to be there on monday but from reviewing the class notes, I think I would still like clarification for how things are stored within github. I know this is a bit of a hard question to ask because the internet is already kind of an abstraction that I don't really understand but I think maybe more claification of the level of understanding that would be useful to use it, for example, should I just know how to do things? should I know what those actions are doing beyond the changes I see on the screen? etc. 

3. Was the drawing activity at the start of class helpful for understanding some of the reasons we use GitHub? Was it enjoyable? Both? Neither? (If you weren't present for class on Monday April 28, please just write "absent") 
I was absent but that sounds fun.
